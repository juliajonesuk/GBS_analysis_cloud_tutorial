Tutorial introduction
=====================

For an evolutionary biologist, genotype-by sequencing (GBS) and new genomic tools are great opportunities, but the fast-changing field can be very challenging to follow. The most important tool for GBS, after your brain and the sequencer, is your computer. GBS analysis can be very demanding on personal computers, there can be not enough CPU and/or memory and the analysis can crash or worse, your computer is now solely dedicated to this task and nothing else. Large up-to-date university computer clusters are a long-term solution but come with their share of problems. In the beginning most students will feel lost and very intimidated by everything related to computers, software and GBS analysis. Commonly the end result is that your scientific work flow is impeded.

This step-by-step tutorial is a risk-free paragliding tandem flight into the cloud. We will guide you through the process of leveraging the cloud to analyse your GBS data. We chose Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for these reasons:

1. easy (extensive documentation and big community to ask for help)
2. cheapest machines (with highest CPU and Memory)
3. write off computer and software cost as an operating expense rather than a capital or service expenditure (depending on countries and universities).
4. you control everything



.. Warning::
 
 This tutorial assume you have read our TREE paper (link soon) and although you can go through this tutorial with *copy and paste* commands, we think you should know how to use very basic *Terminal* commands.
 
 Don't have basic Terminal knowledge? We will show you links and tricks in this tutorial. Scared of using Command Line Interface ? Fear not! You use your phone to text your friends... **the Terminal is now your new best friend to TEXT commands to your computer!** Something younger generations of evolutionary biologists should have no problem understanding!
